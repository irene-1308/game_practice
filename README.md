# Trivia Quiz Game

Welcome to the Trivia Quiz Game! This game was developed during the third week of a coding bootcamp, showcasing fundamental JavaScript skills such as DOM manipulation, API fetching, and event handling. The game is a simple yet engaging quiz where players answer True or False questions sourced from an external API.




## How the Game Works

The game fetches a set of 10 random True/False questions from the Open Trivia Database API. Players are presented with one question at a time, and they must choose between True or False. After each answer, feedback is provided to let the player know whether their answer was correct or incorrect. The game tracks the player's score, and at the end, displays the final score.
