# 🎉 Trivia Quiz Game 🎉

Welcome to the **Trivia Quiz Game**! 🚀 This game was created during week 3 of a coding bootcamp, showing off my newly acquired JavaScript skills like DOM manipulation, API fetching, and event handling. It’s a fun, fast-paced True or False quiz, with questions pulled straight from an external API! 🎮

## 🚀 How the Game Works

The game fetches 10 random True/False questions from the Open Trivia Database API. Players get immediate feedback after answering and can track their score. At the end, your final score is displayed. Can you get 10/10? 🌟
